There are five docs in the Historian folder. 
Those docs are to descript the five phases in regards to how to connect and transmit data between the Node-Red with the MySQL server.
Specifically, Phase 1 is to install MySQL on a Raspberry Pi where the Raspbian OS has already been installed.
Phase 2 is to Create a database and use it with Python
Phase 3 is to Read out data from a MySQL database with Node-Red
Phase 4 is an example of how to take out only one element from an array and present it in a Node-Red UI.
Phase 5 is to read in data from a Node-Red into a MySQL.

Phase 1 and 5 will be highly used in IT Project 2. The other phases are to demonstrate an integral practice in regards to the Raspberry Pi, 
Node-Red as well as MySQL server.

References, including web pages and tutorial videos, will be listed at the end of each phase. In addition, two Node-Red flows are attached 
in this folder to demonstrate how to read in and out data between the Node-Red and MySQL server.
