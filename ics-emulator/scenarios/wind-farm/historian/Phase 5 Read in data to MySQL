Phase 5 Read in data from Node-Red to MySQL database
For IT Project 2, we need to record data from scenarios implemented in Node-Red into MySQL database.
Thus, Phase 5 is to demonstrate a sample of how to read data into a MySQL database from Node-Red.
The attached video tutorial shows a perfect example of transferring data from Node-Red to MySQL. 
The issue you have to pay attention to is to switch the MySQL command from 'SELECT' to 'INSERT' with the auto-match function.
