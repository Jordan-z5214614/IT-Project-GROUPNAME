# Summary

Made for my wife who is teaching technology to children. they study renewable energy and these real wind turbines.

Video available here : https://youtu.be/wRZg4CXgDV4

Three prints were made at differents scales. 1/100 1/200 1/400
The 2 biggest are motorised with small gear motor found on Internet.
Power is 3v, for the big one, 4 battery AA in // 2 +2 and 2 for the middle one.
no motor in the small one, I didn't found small enough gear motor
It took quite a long time to print the 100 but result is for me nice.
Due to curves some parts has a better looking if printed with 0.1 layer.
For rigidity the 3 blades were not printed verticaly but this can be done also with a better looking.
For the big one you need 2 bearings 604ZZ 4 12 4 mm and a piece of D 4mm rod.

As it is for education purpose, the rod is connected to the motor axle with some kind of "soft coupling". I use gazoil return pipe with D3 interior for D4 for the rod. 
Then if a child try to stop the propeller when running, it stopped despite the motor is still turning with the axle slipping. 

For the smaller one I use scale model fuel pipe with D2 interior, motor axle is 3mm.

when glueing the mast please take care to align internal cavities which are used to let the wiring going through from the top to the bottom where batteries are located.
for wiring I use old network cables. small wires inside are perfects.

For assembly I prefer wood screws, 3 x 16 mm are enough, you will find by yourself where they are located : holes and head location are designed on the parts. Joining rod is included to be able to align all mast's parts.

Rotation is approx 15 rpm which is the same than real things; If you want to go fastern just use 3 AA instead of 2.

Self flashing leds were added on the top, D5mm for the big, D3mm for the medium.

The smaller one has free rotation of the blades.

Hope some of you will be interrested by this design. It's quite nice in the class room.

Proudly printed on my stock CR10 with https://www.arianeplast.com filament. White for most of the parts and bluegrey for the base.

Following request about motors and Led  :

Motor for the 1/100 one : https://www.ebay.fr/itm/Micro-20mm-Full-Metal-Gearbox-Gear-Motor-DC-3V-6V-33RPM-Slow-Speed-Robot-Car/122895314585?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649
With 3V Rpm are 15 approx.

Motor for the 1/200 one : https://www.ebay.fr/itm/Micro-Speed-Reduction-Gear-Motor-with-Metal-Gearbox-Wheel-DC-6V-30RPM-N20/272520292077?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649
With 3V Rpm are 15 approx.

Self flashing Led 5 mm : https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B00WX3284I/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Need a small capacitor between + & - to flash

Self flashing led 5 & 3 mm but christmas tree style : https://www.ebay.fr/itm/3mm-5mm-LED-Fast-Slow-Flash-RGB-Water-Clear-Light-Round-Top-Emitting-Diode-Lamp/263806421271?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=563126768274&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649


These models do not generate any power as they have gear motor to simulate wind effect. Due to a lot of interest, I will try to see what can be the tuning of these blades to obtain some energy. Or design new ones. If anybody knows how to find a small rpm multiplicator which can take place into the nacelle it will help.
