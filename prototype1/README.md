# System Framework

This folder contains the required components for the system. The supervisory_computer folder contains all the files required to run a supervisor Pi, and the PLC folder contains the files for the PLC Pi. Note, if using multiple PLCs each must have a seperate address in config.txt. 

The GUI folder contains a dynamic GUI, which is designed to be run on a seperate machine. See the GUI README for more info.
