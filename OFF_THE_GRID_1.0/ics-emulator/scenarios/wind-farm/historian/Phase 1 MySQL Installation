Phase 1 How to install MySQL on a Raspberry Pi

It is assumed that the Raspbian OS has already been installed on the Raspberry Pi. 
To save space, how to install Raspbian OS will not be discussed here. However, the instructions of the installation of Raspbian OS 
will be listed at the end.

Simply, at first, it is needed to set up an Apache web server and the latest version of PHP module on the Raspberry Pi. 
Followingly, MySQL and PHPmyadmin will be installed. Also, the MySQL secure is needed to create users and their passwords to use
PHPmyadmin. The specific steps and command lines used in Raspberry Pi terminals are listed below,

1. Install Apache
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2 -y

Test the web server
http://localhost/ -----  where you should see the Apache2 Debian Default Page



2. Install PHP
sudo apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php -y

Test PHP with http://localhost/index.php

cd /var/www/html
sudo leafpad index.php
<?php echo "hello world"; ?> ----------------where you should see "hello world", which is not dynamic but still served by PHP. 
<?php echo date('Y-m-d H:i:s'); ?> ----------where you should see the current/dynamic date
<?php phpinfo(); ?>--------------------------where you should see PHP information page



3. Install MySQL and PHPmyadmin
sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server php-mysql phpmyadmin
ATTENTION: mysql-server maybe doesn't exist anymore. However, the system will inform you of the new version(e.g. mariadb-version).

Edit configuration file
sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf ----add this command line at the bottom and then save the file.
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Test PHPmyadmin
If phpmyadmin is installed successfully you should be able to login to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
ATTENTION: you cannot login with the user: root as you need to set at all privileges for the user 'root' to get access on the
MySQL database.



4. Install MySQL Secure
sudo mysql_secure_installation

After installation, you need to run MySQL to set all privileges for the user 'root' with the command lines below
sudo -su ----- switch to root user

mysql -u root - p ----start MySQL with passwords you just set up

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on *.* to 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'huey';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
\q
service mysql stop
service mysql start  ----restart MySQL

Now, you can log into http://localhost/phpmyadmin with the username: root and the password: huey
ATTENTION: if you have any problems with Step 4, the "MySQL Part #1" video can exactly demonstrate you step by step from 4:21 to the end.
