Phase 3 Read out Data & Phase 4 Present data with Node-Red UI

In this phase, we will read out data from the MySQL database built in Phase 2 with Node-Red. Following that, we will present the data with
the Node-Red UI accordingly

Similarly, to read out data from the sample MySQL database and thereby present data, 
you just need to follow the tutorial videos in the reference list.

The only potential problems in this phase are the Manage Palette or the dashboard may be missing in the Node-Red.
The solutions to the missing problems are to upgrade Node-Red with command lines.

For Manage Pallete missing issue,
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red


For Dashboard missing issue,
node-red-stop
cd $HOME/.node-red/node_modules
rm node-red-dashboard -rf
cd $HOME/.node-red
npm install node-red-dashboard
node-red-start
