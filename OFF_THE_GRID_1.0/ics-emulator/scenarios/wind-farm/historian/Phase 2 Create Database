Phase 2 Create Database 

We will create a sample database with the PHPmyadmin set up in Phase 1. The purpose of the creation of the sample database is to prepare it 
for Phase 3 where we will read out data from the MySQL table with Node-Red.

How to create a MySQL table is clearly demonstrated in the tutorial video listed below. 

However, you need to install python3-mysqldb to use database query in Python. Accordingly, the command lines are,
   sudo python3 -m pip install pymysql ------  for python 3.4
or
   sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb ----- for python 2.7 
   
The sample python code, which is called 'write_read-sql.py',  is also attached in the Historian folder.
