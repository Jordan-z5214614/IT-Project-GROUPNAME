# 3D Models and Printing

This document outlines the models used for 3d printing. For rationale and process, please see the [MODELS-Testing.md document](MODELS-Testing.md)
## Common Builds
### Model: LED Power Supply Cover
__Original source:__ The original Mean Well LRS-100-5 switching power supply terminals cover model is found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2762228). It is by 'glassy' and released under the Creative Commons - Attribution licence.

Original files are available here to ensure availability. Please use the originals if possible.

__Changes Made:__ Nil

__Final Print Settings:__ PETG Black at 230'C nozzle, 80'C Bed using 3.0mm 'Draft' preset settings for Prusa PLA

### Model: LED Data line break out box
__Original source:__ The original X model is found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2489553). It is by 'teejaydub' and released under the Creative Commons - Attribution licence.

Original files are available here to ensure availability. Please use the originals if possible.

__Changes Made:__ The side plates were redeveloped to allow the various wiring configurations such as the JST SM plugs we are using in the project. This adds a professional touch and supports the modularity and robustness (protecting wire bend fatigue) in the project.

__Final Print Settings:__ PETG Black at 230'C nozzle, 80'C Bed using 3.0mm 'Draft' preset settings for Prusa PLA

### Model: LED Power termination box
__Original source:__ The original X model is found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2489553). It is by 'teejaydub' and released under the Creative Commons - Attribution licence.

Original files are available here to ensure availability. Please use the originals if possible.

__Changes Made:__ The entire box was cut up and manipulated to suit the dimensions of the terminal block fixing holes. I chose to remix this project as the original design is one of the best box designs I have seen so far. I have also added in specific sides to suit wiring configurations and rubber grommet sizes. 

__Final Print Settings:__ PETG Black at 230'C nozzle, 80'C Bed using 3.0mm 'Draft' preset settings for Prusa PLA


## Scenario 1: Wind Generation
### Model: Wind Turbine

__Original source:__ The original wind turbine model is found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1767153). It is by 'me2space' and released under the Creative Commons - Attribution licence.
These were accessed 2019/08/10.

Original files are available here to ensure availability. Please use the originals if possible.

__Changes Made:__ The turbine nacelle did not fit the high torque low RPM motors that we could source at even 100% scale, therefore the nacelle has required considerable editing to fit the motor. A dummy motor was also contructed to make future alterations simple. The mast support has been altered to allow the fitment of a neopixel strip within the structure. 

__Final Print Settings:__

## Scenario 2: Hospital
### Model: Fridge

__Original source:__ The original fridge model is found [here](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3307792) and was designed by 'terahurts'. The model is licenced under the Creative Commons - Attribution licence.
These were accessed 2019/08/10.

Original files are available here to ensure availability. Please use the originals if possible.

__Changes Made:__ Altered axis measurements to make fridge industrial sized, then scaled 20% from original, while still allowing ftiment of an 8 LED neopixel strip in the rear of the fridge .

__Final Print Settings:__ Prusa Preset DRAFT 0.3mm
