# 3D Model Development and Printing

This document provides an overview of the processes used to develop and iterate models and also to print them.
For the final choices, please refer to the [MODELS.md document](MODELS.md)

## Scenario 1: Wind Generation
### Model: Wind Turbine v1

_Test 1:_
- Printer: Prusa i3 Mk3s
- Filament Type: PLA 3dFillies White
- Infill: 20%
- Other notes: Brim and supports everywhere.

_Test 2:_
- Printer: Prusa i3 Mk3s
- Filament Type: PLA 3dFillies Clear
- Infill: 5%
- Other notes: Brim and supports everywhere.

### Model: Propellers
The original blade 'sticks out' at the back. It's not a nice fit, which is a disappointment for a 3d printable model.

Blades. Left to right: original, original marked for removal, revision 1, revision 2


_Blade Revision 1_
Changes made to connector between the propeller hub and the blades.
Software: Blender

_Blade Revision 2_
Changes made to connector between the propeller hub and the blades.
Fairly minor alterations wrt to revision 1.
Software: Blender

_Propeller Revision 1_
Changes the model - rather than separated blades and a hub, this integrates them both.
Of course, it's ruined because I put them on backwards.
Software: Blender, TinkerCAD online system.

_Propeller Revision 2_
Fixes the mistake of revision 1.

_Propeller Revision 2.1_
Fixes the mistake of revision 2.

### Model: Wind Turbine v2

##### Component: Drive Assembly
_Test 1:_
- Printer: Prusa i3 Mk3s
- Filament Type: PETG 3dFillies White
- Infill: 15%
- Layer Height: 0.2mm 
- Other notes: Brim. Carried out multiple tests to ensure that the interference fit of the drive assy parts aree sufficient enough to deal with the torque of the motor and the spin weight of the blades. Working scaled sizes uploaded. More success with 0.2mm layer height.

##### Component: Nacelle
_Test 1:_
- Printer: Prusa i3 Mk3s
- Filament Type: PLA 3dFillies White
- Infill: 15%
- Layer Height: 0.2mm 
- Other notes: Printed ok with no supports.

_Test 2:_
- Printer: Prusa i3 Mk3s
- Filament Type: PETG 3dFillies White
- Infill: 20%
- Layer Height: 0.3mm 
- Other notes: Revision 2. Second attempt after re-engineering design to fit motor failed with no support from base. Requires support.

_Test 2:_
- Printer: Prusa i3 Mk3s
- Filament Type: PETG 3dFillies White
- Infill: 15%
- Layer Height: 0.2mm 
- Other notes: Support added.

##### Component: Nose Cone
_Test 1:_
- Printer: Prusa i3 Mk3s
- Filament Type: PLA 3dFillies White
- Infill: 15%
- Layer Height: 0.2mm 
- Other notes: Definitely dont use supports. They are impossible to get out of the nooks and crannies in the structure.

## Scenario 2: Hospital
### Model: Fridge
_Test 1:_
- Printer: Prusa i3 Mk3s
- Filament Type: PLA 3dFillies White
- Infill: 20%
- Other notes: Using 20% scale and prusa preset 0.3mm DRAFT
