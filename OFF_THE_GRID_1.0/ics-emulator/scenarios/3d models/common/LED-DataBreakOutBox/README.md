# Info
This set of files details the original files obtained from thingiverse and the changes that were madew to fit the project needs.

## 3D file alterations
The assets are altered to fit the correct amount of input and output connectors in a safe, efficient and modular manner.

## Design
The 3d assets altered for off the grid enable us to create a modular LED dataline breakout box with a common earth. This can be used in conjuction with any raspberry pi load out to provide a safe data line to control neopixels using a 300 - 500 ohm resistor.

## Associated Parts
The design uses:
- an adafruit half-sized perma-proto board
- 4 x 330 ohm resistors for dataline protection
- 4 x JST SM connector pairs
- custom soldered lengths of 22AWG stranded wire in red/black colour
- 2 x M3 by 6mm bolts
