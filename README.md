# Introduction

Aim:

The project aims to allow for a modular framework to enable future ICS simulated hacking scenarios to be built. We have developed a functioning simulated scenario for controlling a powerplant turbine in an industrial control system. We have also created a scenario, using this framework, which emulates a turbine from a nuclear power plant. These scenarios aim to educate and facilitate honing Cyber-Security skills in an Industrial Control System (ICS) context. 

Features supported by this system:
- Hacking a simulated powerplant turbine
- Defining your own scenario
- Creating added systems

History:

This project expands upon a prototype platform for teaching the hacking of cyber-physical systems (such as power grid devices, traffic lights, and critical infrastructure). The current ICS hacking range in use by UNSW has a running cost too high to facilitate its regular use as a teaching resource, however, it uses the real software and hardware of industrial ICS. UNSW is seeking a more cost-effective solution which does not use the real software or hardware. A previous attempt to create a similar scenario was the construction of a wind power turbine, controlled by ICS. This previous project will be built on. 


# QuickStart


#TODO fix physical requirements get more specific (eg. what lego set you brought/or what it comprised of)
 Physical Requirements:
 - Raspberry Pi 4 
 - Raspberry Pi's HDMI connector
 - Raspberry Pi's power supply
 - SD cards containing micro SD card
 - mouse 
 - keyboard
 - Laptop or PC with SD card port
 - Raspberry Pi HATs
(We used the HAT's from the "Adafruit DC & Stepper Motor HAT for Raspberry Pi - Mini Kit". This can be brought from the following link: https://www.adafruit.com/product/2348)

 - lego motor 
(We used the motor from the LEGO® Power Functions medium motor and 2 19.6” (50cm) extension wires, officially titled as the "LEGO® Power Functions M-Motor". This can be brought from the following link: https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-power-functions-m-motor-8883)
