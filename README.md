# Simulated Industrial Control System Hacking

Developed by: $GROUPNAME

# Introduction

Aim:

The project aims to allow for a modular framework to enable future ICS simulated hacking scenarios to be built. We have developed a functioning simulated scenario for controlling a powerplant turbine in an industrial control system.â€¯We have also created a scenario, using this framework, which emulates a turbine from a nuclear power plant. These scenarios aim to educate and facilitate honing Cyber-Security skills in an Industrial Control System (ICS) context. 

Features supported by this system:
- Hacking a simulated powerplant turbine
- Defining your own scenario
- Creating added systems

History:

This project expands upon a prototype platform for teaching the hacking of cyber-physical systems (such as power grid devices, traffic lights, and critical infrastructure). The current ICS hacking range in use by UNSW has a running cost too high to facilitate its regular use as a teaching resource, however, it uses the real software and hardware of industrial ICS. UNSW is seeking a more cost-effective solution which does not use the real software or hardware. A previous attempt to create a similar scenario was the construction of a wind power turbine, controlled by ICS. This previous project will be built on.
