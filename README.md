# Introduction

Aim:

The goal of this project is to make a modular framework for future ICS Scenario building. We also developed a functioning scenario for the ICS controlling a powerplant turbine. We will also be creating a scenario, using this framework, which emulates a turbine from a nuclear power plant. These scenarios aim to educate and facilitate honing Cyber-Security skills in an Industrial Control System (ICS) context.   


History:

This project expands upon a prototype platform for teaching the hacking of cyber-physical systems (such as power grid devices, traffic lights, and critical infrastructure). The current ICS hacking range in use by UNSW has a running cost too high to facilitate its regular use as a teaching resource, however, it uses the real software and hardware of industrial ICS. UNSW is seeking a more cost-effective solution which does not use the real software or hardware. A previous attempt to create a similar scenario was the construction of a wind power turbine, controlled by ICS. This previous project will be built on.
